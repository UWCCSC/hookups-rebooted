anonymous liasons of the most intimate kind, using

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on
how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Hookups requires `python2` and `virtualenv`.

### Installing

After all of the dependencies have been satisfied, create yourself a
`virtualenv` by running:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

Next, you need to install the dependencies with `pip` (`pip2` if you are on
Arch):

```bash
pip install Flask flask-socketio eventlet pycodestyle
```

Finally, to run the server:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=./HookupsRebooted/Hookups.py
flask run
```

## Running the tests

Running the tests is as easy as running the prepared `run_debug.sh` script:

```bash
sh run_debug.sh
```

This script runs both unit and code style tests.
