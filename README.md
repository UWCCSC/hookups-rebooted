# HookupsðŸ’‹ Rebooted

A modern rewrite of the [classic HookupsðŸ’‹](https://github.com/UWCCSC/hookup-csc) app. Built for anonymous liasons of the most intimate kind, using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [Websockets](www.websocket.org), and the latest modern web technologies.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

HookupsðŸ’‹ Rebooted uses [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), a powerful tool that provides declarative, version-controlled development environments. This allows all developers to begin on the same Operating System with the same toolchain. Installing vagrant is simple:

* [Vagrant binary downloads](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [Compile Vagrant from source](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/source.html)
* [Official Vagrant documentation](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/)

### Installing

Once vagrant is installed, it is all a matter of `cd`'ing into the project repository, and running:


```
vagrant up
```

This boots and initializes the virtual machine. The `Vagrantfile` in this project automatically takes care of dependency management, and sets up an `virtualenv` environment for Flask. Once this is complete, simply run:

```
vagrant ssh
```

This creates an shell into the virtual machine. Now you are all set to begin developing! For more information regarding how to use Vagrant, feel free to check out their [quickstart documentation]https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/index.html.
